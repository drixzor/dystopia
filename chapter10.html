As the Bible warns, “Even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light” (2 Corinthians 11:14), and here, that deception unfolds with chilling precision. The people are led to believe they are choosing a side of goodness, truth, and hope, but in reality, they are embracing a system meticulously crafted over time to enslave them in an unbreakable cage. Culture, government, and the very fabric of society have been fine-tuned like an instrument, reaching a perfect crescendo where every element supports the facade.

As the "good" side ascends to power, unchecked and absolute, the true nature of the plan is unveiled—not as the savior they believed in, but as the architect of their servitude to a technocratic state. Every move and thought is tracked, every ounce of autonomy is an illusion. The populace remains oblivious until it is too late, until the final doors of freedom slam shut behind them, locked from within the very system they helped build.
