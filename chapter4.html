Meanwhile, the "bad" party, long vilified for its morally questionable policies and degenerate ideas, has flawlessly executed its role. Over the years, this party has introduced legislation and cultural movements that openly promote moral decay: extreme abortion rights, gender reassignment for children, and radical social changes that shock and disgust large segments of the population.
