        <p class="chapter-text">
This revered leader now holds absolute control over the economy, resources, and every facet of governance. With technology so advanced that it can surveil and influence every action and thought, his rule—under the guise of democracy and justice—ushers in a new form of slavery. This technocratic dystopia is so complete that even the concept of freedom is redefined.

As the populace cheers, believing they are finally free, they remain oblivious to the cage that has closed around them. They have constructed this prison with their own hands, brick by brick, under the illusion of choice, never realizing that both political paths led to the same destination: total control by the very forces they thought they opposed.
