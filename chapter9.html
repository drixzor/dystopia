Disillusionment spreads rapidly. The more these celebrities praise the "bad" side, the more the public recoils, instinctively rejecting what feels increasingly artificial. Deep within, they feel betrayed by those they once admired—actors and musicians who now seem complicit in promoting policies and values that appear alien and destructive. This is all part of a grand design, meticulously crafted by those who understand the subtle psychology of admiration and revulsion. By corrupting symbols of inspiration and aligning them with a despised party, the manipulators ensure that the public clings ever more desperately to the "good" side, unaware they are following a predetermined script.

This decades-long crescendo of social engineering has led to this precise moment. Every piece is now in place: institutions, media, culture, and personal icons have been shaped, molded, and positioned to elicit a specific reaction—driving the public into the arms of the so-called savior they believe is their only hope.
