        <p class="chapter-text">
Reflecting on the Bible, “For false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect” (Matthew 24:24). Here, the “savior” chosen by the people is, in reality, a master of deception—an antichrist figure. Through his control over technology, media, and every aspect of life, he has already prepared the world for his rule, cementing his power through blind devotion.

The machinery of control operates seamlessly. Influential social media platforms and news outlets, subtly manipulated by the technocrat, meticulously filter and frame every narrative. Criticism of the "good" side is erased, dismissed as misinformation or extremism. Voices that question the leader’s motives are silenced, branded as conspiracy theorists, or worse. Those few who perceive the deception find their platforms and accounts suspended, their messages lost in an ocean of propaganda.
