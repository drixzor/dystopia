        <p class="chapter-text">
Under the guise of choice, democracy itself becomes the ultimate tool of control. What once appeared as a vibrant and diverse political landscape converges into a singular, invisible authoritarian framework. As citizens cheer for one party and vilify the other, they inadvertently pave the way for their own subjugation, relinquishing the very freedoms they believe they are defending.

An election arrives, and the "good" side achieves a landslide victory, capturing the popular vote, congressional seats, and seizing control of every crucial government apparatus. The nation is euphoric, convinced that their values and vision have triumphed. The newly elected President, a charismatic figure promising order, stability, and liberation from the chaos instigated by the "bad" party, is hailed as a hero and savior.
